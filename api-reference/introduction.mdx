## Welcome

The Mallory API is a REST API for querying threat intelligence: threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, references, stories, exports, and more. The reference below is **generated from the live OpenAPI spec** so it stays in sync with the deployed API.

## Base URL

Use this base URL for all requests:

```
https://api.mallory.ai
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication. Send your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

See [Authentication](/build/auth) in the docs for how to get an API key and send it.

## What's in the reference

The sidebar (or tabs) for **API Reference** are generated from the OpenAPI spec. You'll find endpoints grouped by resource (e.g. actors, vulnerabilities, references, exports). Use the **Overview** section here for a quick recap; use the generated endpoint pages for parameters, request/response schemas, and examples.
