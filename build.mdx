## Ways to Build

You can integrate Mallory's threat intelligence into your own systems and workflows in three main ways: use the **API** for queries and automation, pull **bulk data** via exports, or use our **open source** clients and tools.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="API" icon="code" href="/build/api/auth">
    Call the Mallory API for search, entities, stories, and more. Authenticate with an API key and use REST or our Python SDK.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Exports" icon="database" href="/build/exports/index">
    Pull vulnerability and IOC intelligence in bulk. Use full or incremental exports on a schedule for pipelines and data lakes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Source" icon="github" href="/build/opensource">
    Use our Python client, MCP server, Asset Query, and Claude Code plugins to embed Mallory in your tools and AI workflows.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## API

Use the Mallory API when you need to **query on demand**, power UIs, or automate workflows. You can search vulnerabilities, threat actors, malware, stories, and references; filter and paginate; and use our [search syntax](/build/api/search-syntax) for full-text and structured queries.

  API keys and Bearer token authentication.

</Card>

## Exports (Our Data)

Use **exports** when you need **bulk or scheduled data**—for example, syncing into your data lake, SIEM, or internal systems. Exports are generated on a schedule (e.g. hourly) and support vulnerability intelligence and IOC (observables/opinions) formats.

  Schema and fields for vulnerability exports.
</Card>
<Card title="IOC intelligence format" icon="file-lines" href="/build/exports/ioc-intel-format">

## Open Source Tooling

Use our **open source** projects to embed Mallory in the tools you already use: a typed Python client, an MCP server for Cursor and Claude Code, Asset Query for asset discovery, and Claude Code plugins for adversary emulation and vulnerability escalation.
