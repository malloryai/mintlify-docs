## Bulk export

You can pull the latest intelligence from the platform in bulk via the exports API. Exports are generated on a schedule (e.g. roughly hourly).

### Export strategies

- **full** – Full export of the selected type
- **incremental** – Incremental export (changes since last run)

### Export types

Supported export types include:

- **Vulnerability intelligence** – Full schema and field reference: [Vulnerability intelligence export format](/build/exports/vuln-intel-format)
- **IOC intelligence** – Observables and opinions: [IOC intelligence export format](/build/exports/ioc-intel-format)

You must specify `export_strategy` and `export_type` (or rely on documented defaults). The API returns a link to download the export, typically as a `.tar.gz` file.

### Getting the latest export

Use the **GET** `/v1/exports/latest` endpoint with the desired query parameters. See the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for the exact parameters and response shape.

### Other export endpoints

The API may expose additional export-related endpoints (e.g. by type or by entity). Check the API Reference under **Exports** or the relevant resource.
