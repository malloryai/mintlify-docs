## Integrations overview

Mallory can integrate with your existing tools and workflows via:

- **API** – Use the REST API to query entities, references, exports, and more from your own apps and scripts.
- **Integrations API** – Create and manage integration configurations (e.g. Slack, email, SIEM) via the API when supported.
- **Webhooks** – (When available) Receive events or notifications when certain conditions are met.

### What you can do

- **Query intelligence** – Pull threat actors, vulnerabilities, malware, and indicators programmatically.
- **Bulk export** – Schedule or trigger exports for ETL, SIEM, or data lakes. See [Exports](/build/exports).
- **Configure integrations** – Set up outbound integrations (e.g. alerts to Slack or email) via the app or API when the feature is available.

The exact integration surface (webhooks, integration types, and configuration) is documented in the API and in-app flows. Check the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for endpoints under **Integrations** or **Exports**.
