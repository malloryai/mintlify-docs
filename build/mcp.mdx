## Mallory MCP Server

The **Mallory MCP Server** connects Mallory's cybersecurity intelligence to your AI assistants using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). You can query threat intelligence, vulnerabilities, and exploitation data from within tools like Claude Code, Cursor, or other MCP clients.

### What you can do

- Query vulnerability data by CVE ID
- Track real-world exploitation of vulnerabilities
- Research threat actors and TTPs
- Monitor emerging threats
- Access detailed intelligence on security incidents

### Requirements

- A Mallory account and [API key](/build/auth)
- Python 3.13 or higher (for the reference server implementation)
- Basic familiarity with the command line and your AI assistant’s MCP setup

### Installation

1. **Get your API key** – Sign in at [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai) and create an API key from your account or dashboard.

2. **Clone and install the MCP server** (example for the official repo):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/malloryai/mallorymcp.git
   cd mallorymcp
   ```

3. **Set up the environment** – Create a virtual environment and install:

   ```bash
   # With uv (recommended)
   uv venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -e .

   # Or with pip
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Configure** – Create a `.env` in the project root with your API key:

   ```
   MALLORY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Configure your MCP client** – Add the Mallory MCP server to your client’s config (e.g. Cursor or Claude Code MCP settings) so it starts the server and passes the environment. See your client’s docs and the [mallorymcp](https://github.com/malloryai/mallorymcp) repo for the exact command and args.

### Using the tools

Once the server is running and connected, you can ask your AI assistant to use Mallory tools (e.g. “Look up CVE-2024-1234” or “What do we know about APT29?”). The assistant will call the MCP server, which uses your API key to talk to the Mallory API.
