## Trending and monitoring

Mallory exposes endpoints to monitor **trending** and **recent** activity: trending stories, trending entities (e.g. vulnerabilities, threat actors), and trending or recent IOCs. Use these to build dashboards, alerts, or feeds that stay up to date.

### Typical use cases

- **Trending vulnerabilities** – See which CVEs or vulns are gaining attention
- **Trending threat actors** – Track which actors are most mentioned over a window
- **Trending stories** – Latest or most active stories across sources
- **Trending IOCs** – Observable activity over time
- **Diff-style endpoints** – e.g. “what’s new or changed” since a previous run (where supported)

### How to use it

1. Call the relevant **trending** or **monitoring** endpoints from the API (e.g. `/v1/vulnerabilities/trending/diff`, or entity-specific trending endpoints). See the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for the full list.
2. Use **sort** parameters (e.g. `trending_1d`, `trending_7d`, `trending_30d`) on list endpoints where available to order by trend.
3. Combine with **exports** or **incremental** patterns for bulk or scheduled sync.

Details (parameters, response shape, and rate limits) are in the API Reference.
