## Chat with your intelligence

Mallory's **Chat** is a contextualized conversational interface that lets you query, explore, and reason over Mallory's intelligence data in natural language.

### What you can do

- **Ask about entities** – Threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, organizations
- **Explore relationships** – How entities are linked and where they're discussed
- **Investigate recent activity** – Trending and recent mentions across sources
- **Get summaries** – Context and insights without digging through raw data

### How to use Chat

1. Open **Chat** from the app (e.g. [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai)).
2. Type your question in plain language (e.g. "What do we know about LockBit?" or "Recent mentions of CVE-2024-1234").
3. Use follow-up questions to go deeper; Chat keeps context of the conversation.

### Tips

- Be specific when you ask about an entity (name, alias, or CVE ID).
- You can ask for comparisons, timelines, or related entities.
- Chat uses the same entities, references, and mentions that power the rest of Mallory—so you're always querying live intelligence.
