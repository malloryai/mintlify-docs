## Current events

**Current Events** gives you a curated overview of the latest threats and vulnerabilities. Content is sourced from open intelligence, analyzed, and summarized so you can consume and act on it quickly.

### What you'll see

- Recent high-signal threat and vulnerability coverage
- Summaries and key points from multiple sources
- Links to underlying references and entities when you need to go deeper

### How to use it

1. Open **Current Events** (or the equivalent dashboard) in the app (e.g. [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai)).
2. Scan the feed for items relevant to your environment or research.
3. Click through to references or entity pages for full context and IOCs.

## Dashboards

Mallory may offer dashboards that aggregate current events, trending entities, or other views. Use them to monitor what matters to your team without leaving the product.
