## Entities in Mallory

Entities are part of the **Library** in Mallory—along with [Observables](/use/observables)—where you browse and manage core intelligence objects.

**Entities** are the core objects Mallory tracks: threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, organizations, and related types. Each entity page is a focal point for names, aliases, relationships, and linked intelligence.

### Entity Types

Mallory exposes these entity types via the API; each has list and detail endpoints in the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction).

**Primary entities**

- **Threat actors** – Groups and campaigns (e.g. APT29, Lazarus)
- **Malware** – Families and variants (e.g. LockBit, QakBot)
- **Vulnerabilities** – CVEs and related advisories
- **Organizations** – Companies, vendors, and other named organizations

**Related entity types**

- **Attack Patterns** – MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques and subtechniques
- **Breaches** – Incidents and linked organizations
- **Detection signatures** – Signatures and rules for detecting threats
- **Exploitations** – Links between vulnerabilities and exploits
- **Exploits** – Exploit code and tools
- **Products** – Technology products (software, hardware)
- **Advisories** – Vendor advisories tied to products and vulnerabilities

### What you can do

- **Search and filter** – Find entities by name, alias, or other criteria
- **View entity pages** – See display name, aliases, description, and related entities
- **Follow mentions** – See which references mention the entity and in what context
- **Use related indicators** – Pivot to IOCs and observables tied to the entity

### How to use it

1. Go to **Intelligence** (or **Entities**) in the app (e.g. [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai)).
2. Use the search and filters to narrow by type, name, or other attributes.
3. Open an entity to see its details, mentions, and related intelligence.

## API Access

You can list and retrieve all of the entity types above via the API. The [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) documents every entity endpoint (e.g. `/v1/actors`, `/v1/vulnerabilities`, `/v1/malware`, `/v1/organizations`, `/v1/attack_patterns`, `/v1/breaches`, `/v1/exploits`, and the rest).
