## Threat entities in Mallory

**Threat entities** are the core objects Mallory tracks: threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, organizations, and related types. Each entity page is a focal point for names, aliases, relationships, and linked intelligence.

### Entity types

- **Threat actors** – Groups and campaigns (e.g. APT29, Lazarus)
- **Malware** – Families and variants (e.g. LockBit, QakBot)
- **Vulnerabilities** – CVEs and related advisories
- **Organizations** – Companies, vendors, and other named organizations
- **Other** – Attack patterns, breaches, and related entity types as supported

### What you can do

- **Search and filter** – Find entities by name, alias, or other criteria
- **View entity pages** – See display name, aliases, description, and related entities
- **Follow mentions** – See which references mention the entity and in what context
- **Use related indicators** – Pivot to IOCs and observables tied to the entity

### How to use it

1. Go to **Intelligence** (or **Threat entities**) in the app (e.g. [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai)).
2. Use the search and filters to narrow by type, name, or other attributes.
3. Open an entity to see its details, mentions, and related intelligence.

## API access

You can list and retrieve entities via the API. See the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for endpoints such as `/v1/actors`, `/v1/vulnerabilities`, `/v1/malware`, and `/v1/organizations`.
