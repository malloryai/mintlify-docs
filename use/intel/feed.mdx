## What is the Feed

The **Feed** is your customized view of stories—curated threat intelligence tailored to what matters to you. Content is sourced from open intelligence, analyzed, and summarized so you can consume and act on it quickly. To see all stories (not just your feed), go to **Monitor** → **Stories** in the app.

### What You'll See

- Recent high-signal threat and vulnerability coverage
- Summaries and key points from multiple sources
- Links to underlying references and entities when you need to go deeper

### How to Use It

1. Open **The feed** in the app (e.g. [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai)).
2. Scan the feed for items relevant to your environment or research.
3. Click through to references or entity pages for full context and IOCs.

## How the feed is built

Content in the feed is built from **stories** and profile-relevant **Entities**. Mallory continuously ingests raw articles, reports, and advisories from thousands of sources as references, which are then analyzed to detect and resolve **entities**—such as threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, organizations, and related types. Rather than showing references directly, Mallory uses them to build and update stories that group related entities and context into clear narratives (e.g. a campaign, a CVE, or a breach). This way, you get summarized, actionable intelligence instead of a stream of raw URLs, and the feed always reflects the latest relevant developments.
