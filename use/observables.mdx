## Observables (IOCs)

**Observables** are evidence of potential malicious activity: IP addresses, domains, file hashes, URLs, email addresses, and similar artifacts. Mallory aggregates and enriches them from multiple sources and links them to entities (e.g. malware families or threat actors).

### What you get

- **Normalized observables** – Deduplicated where applicable
- **Entity links** – Which malware, actor, or campaign they're associated with
- **Context over time** – When and where they were observed or reported

### Use Cases

- **Detection** – Feed IOCs into your SIEM or detection stack
- **Hunting** – Pivot from an entity to its observables
- **Response** – Validate and contextualize IOCs during investigations

### How to use it

1. Use the **Observables** experience in the app (e.g. [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai)), or
2. Query the API (e.g. observables or entity-specific observable endpoints) for programmatic access.

See the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for the relevant endpoints.

### In the app

**Observables listing** – Search and filter IOCs and observables:

**Observables detail** – View a single observable and its context:
