## Search

**Search** in Mallory lets you find threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, organizations, references, and other intelligence from a single place. Use it to discover entities by name or alias, locate references that mention a topic, or narrow results with filters.

### What you can do

- **Find entities** – Search by display name, alias, or identifier (e.g. CVE ID, actor name)
- **Discover references** – Locate articles, reports, and advisories that mention a given topic
- **Filter and narrow** – Apply type, date, or other filters to focus results

### How to use it

1. Use **Search** in the app (e.g. [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai)).
2. Enter a query (entity name, CVE, keyword, or phrase).
3. Refine with filters or switch between entity types and references as needed.

### In the app

**Search listing** – Run a query and see entities and references that match:

For filter syntax and query parameters when using the API, see [Search & filter syntax](/build/search-syntax).
